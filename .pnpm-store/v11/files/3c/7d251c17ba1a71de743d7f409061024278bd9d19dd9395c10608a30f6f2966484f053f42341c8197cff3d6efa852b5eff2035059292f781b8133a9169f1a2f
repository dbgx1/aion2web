/**
 * Extract `headers` and `signal` from a `Request | RequestInit` for the
 * OpenRouter SDK's per-call request-options. `Request` exposes `headers` as a
 * `Headers` instance (HeadersInit-compatible) while `RequestInit` exposes
 * `HeadersInit` directly — this helper accepts either shape so callers don't
 * need to cast.
 *
 * Always returns an object (possibly empty) rather than `undefined` so test
 * assertions that match the second argument shape via `expect.anything()` /
 * `expect.objectContaining()` keep working when no request override was set.
